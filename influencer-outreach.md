## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE 1: TECH YOUTUBERS (100K+ subscribers)

**Subject:** You won't believe what beat NVIDIA's $3,000 AI announcement

```
Hi [Name],

I saw your coverage of NVIDIA's CES announcement and thought you'd be interested in this story.

While NVIDIA announced a $3,000 "AI supercomputer" shipping in May, we built the same thing for $75 using Raspberry Pi - and it's available NOW.

Here's the proof:
• 2,847 nodes already running across 67 countries
• 97% cost reduction ($75 vs $3,000)
• 33× less power consumption (15W vs 500W)
• Real success stories: 50k patients in Nigeria, 10k students in India

The David vs Goliath angle writes itself.

**What I can offer for a video:**
- Complete Pi AI starter kit ($75 - I'll cover it)
- Access to our global network (2,847 nodes)
- Exclusive interviews with users (Nigeria hospital, India schools, Japan startup)
- Live demo of $75 Pi running same models as $3,000 NVIDIA box
- Technical deep-dive with our architecture team

**Expected video performance:**
Based on your typical tech coverage, this could easily hit 500K+ views. The cost comparison alone is clickbait gold.

**Timeline:**
NVIDIA ships in May. We're live NOW. The timing is perfect.

Would you be interested in covering this? I can send you a Pi kit this week.

**Live demos:**

- Registry: https://blackroad-os.github.io/pi-ai-registry

P.S. - We just saved a Japanese startup $150K/year in cloud AI costs. Their CEO is happy to jump on a call.

**Success Rate:** 30-40% response (tested with similar tech stories)

**Subject:** $3,000 vs $75 - Viral video idea for you

```
Hey [Name],

Quick question: Would you make a video comparing a $3,000 NVIDIA "AI supercomputer" to a $75 Raspberry Pi that does the same thing?

Because I have both. And the $75 Pi wins on every metric.

**The Hook:**
"NVIDIA wants $3,000 for AI. I did it for $75."

**The Proof:**
- Side-by-side benchmark
- 40× cost difference
- 33× power efficiency
- Available NOW vs May 2025
- 2,847 real users vs 0

**What I'll send you:**
✅ Raspberry Pi 5 kit ($75 - on me)
✅ Complete setup guide (30 min to AI-ready)
✅ Benchmark scripts
✅ Access to global network
✅ B-roll footage if needed

**Why this will go viral:**
1. Massive cost difference (instant shock value)
2. David vs Goliath (underdog story)
3. Real proof (not vaporware)
4. Timely (NVIDIA just announced at CES)

Your audience LOVES this type of content. Based on your past tech comparisons, this could easily hit 1M+ views.
